                  <p>
                    I have spent 15 years training in ITF Taekwon-do, a Korean
                    martial art developed in the 1940s by General Choi Hong-Hi
                    during the Korean civil war. During my training I have
                    achieved a Second-Dan Black Belt, a rank which I am
                    extremely proud of as it took much dedication and
                    perseverance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I have also earned numerous medals in tournaments,
                    competitions and championships in the Sparring, Pattern and
                    Special Technique categories. Most recently I earned silver
                    competing in the World ITF Taekwondo Championships. In my
                    last 5 years of training, I became a teacher and
                    demonstrator and aided in the running of several events.

                  <p>
                    Definitely a 180 degree turn from the martial arts however,
                    during lockdown, like many people I found my passion for
                    baking. I enjoy both the freedom and pressure this activity
                    offers while also letting my creativity flow freely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over the years I have gotten more and more grandiose with my
                    baking excursions and while I still love baking the
                    occasional chocolate chip cookies, my favourite style of
                    baking has been Korean pastries. These offer more ambitious
                    techniques and utilisation of natural flavourings and
                    methods of incorporating these in my deserts.

                  <p>
                    From a young age I have enjoyed creatively expressing
                    myself. This started with pottery, jewellery making and
                    drawing. I developed this skill and passion in high school
                    as the curriculum offered a more structured and deliberate
                    way of polishing my abilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over the years I developed an affinity for oil painting,
                    especially on a larger scale as this more fit my style of
                    portraiture. I ended up applying to The Glasgow School of
                    Art and getting accepted however ultimately, I changed my
                    education trajectory to computing science.
