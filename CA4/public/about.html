              <p>
                I have spent 15 years training in ITF Taekwon-do, a Korean
                martial art developed in the 1940s by General Choi Hong-Hi
                during the Korean civil war. During my training I have achieved
                a Second-Dan Black Belt, a rank which I am extremely proud of as
                it took much dedication and perseverance.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have also earned numerous medals in tournaments, competitions
                and championships in the Sparring, Pattern and Special Technique
                categories. Most recently I earned silver competing in the World
                ITF Taekwondo Championships. In my last 5 years of training, I
                became a teacher and demonstrator and aided in the running of
                several events.

              <br />

              <p>
                Definitely a 180 degree turn from the martial arts however,
                during lockdown, like many people I found my passion for baking.
                I enjoy both the freedom and pressure this activity offers while
                also letting my creativity flow freely.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the years I have gotten more and more grandiose with my
                baking excursions and while I still love baking the occasional
                chocolate chip cookies, my favourite style of baking has been
                Korean pastries. These offer more ambitious techniques and
                utilisation of natural flavourings and methods of incorporating
                these in my deserts.
              </p>

              <p>
                From a young age I have enjoyed creatively expressing myself.
                This started with pottery, jewellery making and drawing. I
                developed this skill and passion in high school as the
                curriculum offered a more structured and deliberate way of
                polishing my abilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the years I developed an affinity for oil painting,
                especially on a larger scale as this more fit my style of
                portraiture. I ended up applying to The Glasgow School of Art
                and getting accepted however ultimately, I changed my education
                trajectory to computing science.
